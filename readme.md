# The Albert Bar & Restaurant Website Development Plan
## Project Overview
The goal is to create a sophisticated, user-friendly website for The Albert Bar & Restaurant, drawing inspiration from the elegant design of the Brooklands Hotel’s website, specifically the 1907 Restaurant page. The website will feature two key interactive pages:

Table Booking System: A visual representation of current bookings and the user’s potential reservation.
Menu Page: Interactive menu with 3D dish visuals, allergy information, and a pre-order system.

The website will prioritize style, elegance, and seamless functionality, using JavaScript for front-end interactivity and Python for back-end logic. Limited images and restaurant details will be handled with placeholders until professional photos and scans are available.

## Objectives

Create a visually stunning, responsive website that reflects The Albert’s upscale ambiance, inspired by the clean, modern aesthetic of the Brooklands Hotel's inspiration.
Develop a table booking system with a real-time visual layout of available tables and bookings.
Build an interactive menu page where users can view 3D dish models with allergy information and pre-order items via a drag-and-drop or checkbox system.
Ensure seamless integration between the booking and menu pages for a cohesive user experience.
Use placeholders for images and restaurant-specific data until professional assets are provided.
